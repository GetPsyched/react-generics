# react-generics

A React package containing multiple HTML input wrappers.

## Details

This package is a collection of customisable wrappers around several input generics of HTML. The aim is to create more "types" of inputs that HTML does not already provide; for example, OTP input, phone number inputs with country code, country select, etc.
